# Installation guide

Currently there is no installer for Klimakonflikt.

You install by unpacking the zip file and copying the folder to a location of your choice. On a 64 bit system you have to copy to the "Program Files (x86)" folder.

If XNA studio 3.1 or the XNA 3.1 redistributable is not installed on your system, you have to install it by doubleclicking on the xnafx31_redist.msi file.
